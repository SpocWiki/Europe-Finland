> **Southwest Finland** is since 2019 the official name in English 
> for the region in the southwest of Finland hitherto known as Finland Proper. 
> 
> In Finnish and Swedish, the region still retains the previous name 
> (Finnish: Varsinais-Suomi, IPA: [ˈʋɑrs̠inɑi̯s̠ˌs̠uo̞̯mi]; Swedish: Egentliga Finland). 
> It borders the regions of Satakunta, Pirkanmaa, Tavastia Proper (Kanta-Häme), Uusimaa, 
> and Åland. 
> The region's capital and most populous city is Turku, 
> which was the capital city of Finland before Helsinki.
>
> The area is largely the same as the historical province of Finland Proper, 
> so named because it is the original home of the tribe known as the Finns proper.
